# Project Title

This project is an alternative to garbage, a Node.js package that offers an interaction with Github as if you were using your command line simulating a tree structure that provides all the options at your level in the tree Github account or your organization.

Unlike ghshell, this project will incorporate a desktop interface using electron to facilitate the management of Github-ClassRooms in a visual way.
